I woke up dozens of times throughout the night and eventually had to get up because I could not sleep with the air being the way it is. We now have three major polluters: Beaver, Clairton, and Braddock. We're getting slammed from every direction and I despair the thought of never being able to escape this h*ll.",

I have a horrible headache, both my eyes and nose are irritated and burning, my throat is ripped up and I sound like I spent the night chain-smoking. My lungs physically hurt. My heart rate has been variable all night, bouncing between between dangerously low and tachycardia, which is apparently exactly what happens whenever a person is exposed to this level of VOCs at this amount for this long. I was extremely thirsty throughout the night and that got in the way of sleep, not to mention all of the above occurring overnight (again) getting in the way of my being able to actually get the rest I need to function. I experienced both both insomnia and sleeplessness. When the pollution is this intense and this relentless, I wake up exhausted regardless of how long I have slept. I feel cursed to be stuck in such 
hellish conditions without a way out.

This air here is miserable and is the single biggest reason why I am working so hard to get the tf out of this city. This is going to be the next Cancer Alley, mark my words, and I’m not going to be here for it. I have watched far too many people die of bizarre cancers, and neurological disorders. I, too, now have to live with a neurological disorder. There is no doubt in my mind that this ish is the reason why.

So. Pittsburgh doesn’t care about me or anyone else. Fine, duck Pittsburgh, and most of all duck Rich Fitzgerald. The amount of interaction is a palling. Not just in this arena, but also in the jail, oversight, board meetings, refusing to meet with constituents, stonewalling people who are looking for answers. The man has wasted his time and all of our money on making himself happy, instead of actually caring about a whole city of people who elected him. Supposedly he works for us, but you would never know it. I want to see that pathetic excuse for a human being man to be sued for not doing his job, and I want him to return every penny that Pittsburgh ever gave him. Thousands if not millions of people are going to die over the years from all the pollution that is not going away anytime soon. Their (and let’s be honest, probably my own ) deaths are on his hands. I will feel fortunate if I wake up on my 50th birthday. I don’t expect my body will make it that long.","This place is a living h*ll. I have but one goal in my life: leave Pittsburgh forever. It breaks my heart, but there is no choice. I will find a way out of this place because I am not going to die the way I saw so many people I love painfully leave this world. It is appalling to me that more action is not taken. The health department is a joke. I actively encourage people NOT to move to Pittsburgh and if they are here, I encourage them to get the h*ll out. Pittsburgh doesn’t deserve our money or time and they certainly don’t care about you or your health."

It just gets worse.

We get a little breaks on Christian holidays and sometimes Sundays but the rest of the time living here is just h*ll. It’s difficult to eat or have any sort of appetite whenever you’re constantly nauseated. I’m losing weight and my hair is falling out. This place is a disaster and living here is a never ending nightmare. We truly are due to be the next Cancer Alley.

I would bet every penny to my name that in 5 - 10 years we will see even more people dying of cancers, heart problems, and neurological disorders. Rates of conditions like asthma are only going to increase more than they already have. People living here will be substantially more susceptible to getting sick, more so than we already are. This is already a problem and it’s only getting worse with the new plant in Beaver. 2022 has been one of the most hellish years and I don’t expect 2023 to be any better.",Take the new year to make a fresh start: allow Pittsburgh to have clean  air.

This will be Rich (ribbon-cutting) Fitzgerald’s legacy: every time a child has to use an asthma inhaler and it reeks of eggs while the VOC is through the roof we will all think on Rich and his massive failure to accomplish anything for the people ","What does it feel like today? The same as it does just about every other day! My head is throbbing for the third or fourth day in a row; eyes are burning and redder than the devil’s pinky; my nose is irritated; my throat is raw; my lungs hurt when I breathe; I am nauseated and have been all night; last night I experienced both insomnia and sleeplessness; my body is swollen and sore from head to toe; overnight I documented tachycardia, which comes with anxiety and panic; but above all I feel an overwhelming amount of complete and utter despair, at this point. ","I am dying. I mean that. My body is just a wreck at this point. Note: I am in my mid 30s. I am Pittsburgh, born and bread, and rather than being proud of that I see it as a curse, at this point. As I have said many times: this, please could be a paradise to live in, were it not for the horrific pollution and lead water. Here’s hoping somebody can get something accomplished in 2023. I’m not holding my breath. Lord knows that’s hard enough right now."

We're suffering and dying from asthma, chronic disease, insomnia, cancer, and more just to let a bunch of greedy extractionists reap greater profit from the manufacturing of tiny plastic pellets. 

children, adults, animal friends are slowly, painfully dying every day from a poison plant funded by their own taxes. think of all the beautiful things that these hundreds of thousands of people could do if they weren't struggling just to get through the day. 

I invite you all to mourn the incalculable waste of human potential with me. They've made h*ll out of one of the most beautiful places on earth. This needs to stop."
